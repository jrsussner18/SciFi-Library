# SciFi-Library

This project is the final project from my Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis course at the University of Tampa. It dives into a fictional science fiction library, then using different data structures like a binary search tree, priority heap, stacks, and queues it gives the "library" functionality. The pdf file included in this repository gives more information and is the rubric used for this assignment. 


## Reflection

#### What I learned:
- How to implement certain data structures to maximize functionality.
- Writing my own heap data structure.
- How to manipulate a node to hold multiple data types.

#### What I could improve on:
- Coding style, this is a early version of my coding abilities. I know that as I progress my coding style will improve. 
- Trying out different data structures that even though may not be the most effective, will help me to learn more about them.
